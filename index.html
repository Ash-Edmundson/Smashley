   <h2>Product Designer | Performance Coach | Artist | Entrepreneur</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>Based in Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, I'm a product designer at Shopify focused on building out longterm foundations and distinguishing the principles of our App and Partner Platform to make entrepreneurship better for everyone, everywhere, and I have a particular affinity for mobile experiences.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>In my spare time, I've spent the last 1.5 years putting myself in leadership/communications training, developing a deeper understanding of human behaviour, and practicing as a performance coach for a diverse range of humans who are committed to accomplishing big things in the world/their lives; I work with them to identify their gaps, and what normally stop them to begin producing new/desired results.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I also am an avid doodler, entrepreneur, and coffee addict.
